# CSE490 Reinforcement Learning

This is a project for my CSE490 "Reinforcement Learning" course at BRAC University. 

The acrobot system consists of two joints and two links, where the joint between the two links is actuated. Initially, the links are hanging downwards, and the goal is to swing the end of the lower link up to a given height. The agent has been trained using Deep Q-Learning algorithm in order to achieve this. As part of the project, we also had to create a report in IEEE paper format.
